# Kunafa Philosophy

The main goal of Kunafa is to create web development fun. It takes a pragmatic approach to abstracting the complexities of the underlying technologies. As such, it provides helper functions and classes so that developers can think in higher level of abstraction than working directly with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Kunafa tries to be a complete solutions for web developers in an unopinionated way.

## What Kunafa is NOT:
- Kunafa is not a wrapper around HTML and CSS.
